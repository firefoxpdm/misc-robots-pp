# Specialized Robots
The robots coming from Misc. Robots++ have been cut up into different sub-types:

Kitchen robot is now separated into a Kitchen (for cooking and butchering jobs) and a Plant (for plant tending jobs) robot.

Crafter robot is now separated into a Crafting, a Smithing, and a Tailoring robot.

Builder robot is now separated into a Building and a Mining robot.

Also increased the robotic component crafting time to 8000, because finishing it immediately is a bit unrealistic.

# Hydroponics Soiled
Adds new images to normal and VGP Garden Tools hydroponics basins with soil in them.

Sorry for the bad pun.

# Additional robots
Additional robot type:

Fishing robot for Rainbeau Flambe's Fishing mod.

Beekeeping robot for the RimBees mod.

# Rich traders
Changes the minimum and maximum amount of silver the traders have by multiplying them with 100. No other trait is modified.

Traders of the following mods are affected:
- Core
- Android tiers
- Misc. Robots
- Additional Joy Objects Lite
- Genetic Rim

# Bulk jobs
Adds bulk versions of some of the bills (eg. psychite tea and smokeleaf making).

# Sellable stone blocks
Makes the stone blocks sellable to traders.
