<description>	Mod Version: 1.0.0

Contains a new image replacing the normal hydroponics basins with one that actually has some soil in it as I hate that the plants are just hanging in the air.

If VGP Tools is also installed, it replaced the advanced hydroponics basin with one that has tilled soil in it.
